# HistoryIsAMaze
Physics-based puzzle game where the user must guide a ball through a maze to the exit. Made using Unity.



This project was made as coursework my A-Level Computer Science. I recieved an A* for my work.



The objective of the game is to rotate the maze to guide a ball to the exit of the maze. The are obstacles in the player's way: enemies that patrol the maze (using basic AI), a barrier to the exit where the user must find the corresponding button to open, and walls that obstruct the path (to deal with this the player must plant mines to blow up the walls).

The graphical style is a large aspect of the game. Every wall was custom-made using Blender.

Furthermore, the project was documented from the planning phase through to the testing phase.
